## take your card:
is an application which distributes a 52 cards randomly for two players . 
the principle of  the game is to minimize your cards as much as possible and who finishes the first is the winner.
the first player chooses a card from the list and then throws a number of  cards  of his whole. the phone can predict that you did not throw correct cards . so at this stage there are two possibilities:
if the prediction is correct , you will take all the cards  thrown in center
otherwise he will take them.
and so on until the end of game.</br>
